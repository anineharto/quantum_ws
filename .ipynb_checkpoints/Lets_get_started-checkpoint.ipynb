    "There are several ways to make a quantum computer, but the most common one is the universal quantum computer. Algorithms running on these computers are essentially a set of different gate operations imposed on qubits which together form a quantum circuit. We're therefore going to start by manipulating qubits by creating such circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with bits, qubits can be either 0 or 1, but it can also be in something that we call a _superposition_ of 0 and 1. Actually, when it is in this superposition we say that it has a certain probability of being 0 and of being 1. It is when we observe the qubit that we force it to take a value, and then it will be either 0 or 1 depending on the probability. We can therefore think of a qubit as a coin spinning where heads equals 0 and tails equals 1. \n",
