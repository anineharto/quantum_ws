# Getting your hands dirty with Quantum Computing 
These exercise are a collection of python scripts as IPython notebook files. A pre-configured online environment 
(Jupyter Notebook) is prepared to run the exercises. Additionally, if you want to run the quantum algorithms
on a real quantum computer you need to sign up to IBM Q Experience (https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/qx/signup)
and retrieve your API token, which we will insert into the notebook. In order to get starter, follow the upcoming steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local computer: 
   ``git clone https://github.com/anineharto/quantum_ws.git``
2. Run the requirements file: ``pip install -r requirements.txt``
